# Confusion Matrix

- Confusion matrix it is a performance measurement for machine learning classification problem where output can be two or more classes. It is a table with 4 different combinations of predicted and actual values.
- It is extremely useful for measuring Recall, Precision, Specificity, Accuracy and most importantly AUC-ROC Curve.

## About the code 

- In this code, I show how to use the Confusion Matrix to display the result of some data analyses.
- The code is simple and uses a group of data fake without application in anything, just to show it's the process to create.

### Sugestions to continuing contribute in this code

- Search for a real database that can be used in this code.
- Do some cleaning on the data that will be used
- Use the concept shown here to apply in the real world
