# Beginner Express.js Server

This is a quick tutorial for beginners to learn Express.js

- You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed prior to starting this tutorial.
_(If this is your first time downloading Node.js, restart your PC after install, or else NPM commands will not work.)_

- I recommend downloading the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) client in order to test your endpoints.

## How to start the server
Using your terminal either via your OS or VS Code, run the two commands below, in this order:
1. **npm install**
2. **npm start**

Once you've completed the setup, you should see the following in the console after running the above commands:
```
[nodemon] 1.19.3
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching dir(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] starting `node app.js`
Server started successfully!
```
